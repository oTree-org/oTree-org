I am monitoring the keyword **`#oTreeCodeReview`** in GitHub search, so if you put that keyword in your project's settings.py, I will find your project and (if I have time) do a general "makeover", such as fixing any mistakes I see, simplifying things, improving the code organization, etc. 

Note, I generally won't be actually launching the server, so in most cases I can't do deep investigations of specific bugs people are encountering. Also for this reason make sure to test my changes well to make sure I didn't break anything.

If your project is in oTree 3 format (with `models.py`/`pages.py`), the first change I will make is to upgrade it to oTree 5 no-self format.

I will then make a pull request for you to merge/accept.
